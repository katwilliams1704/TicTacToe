Project presentation

1. Design layout
2. Wireframe
3. Pseudocode
4. Use developer tools to debug and solve problems
5. Commit early, commit often

Don't be afraid to write code that you know you'll delete later on 

====================================================================================

Technical Requirements

Your Tic Tac Toe app must:

1. Render a game in the browser
2. Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
3. Visually display which side won or show a draw if neither player wins
4. Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
5. Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
6. Be deployed to GitHub Pages where the rest of the world can access it
7. Use semantic markup (as much as possible) for HTML and CSS

====================================================================================

Necessary Deliverables

1. At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe demonstrating planning.
2. A working game, built by you, hosted on GitHub Pages.
3. A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repository.
4. A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent  commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
5. A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, links to or embedded screenshots of the planning process, installation instructions (if any), unsolved problems, any other useful information etc.

====================================================================================

Stretch Goals

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

1. Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
2. Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
3. Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations
4. Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh
5. Implement a reset button that resets the game without refreshing the whole page
6. Involve Audio in your game
7. Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
8. Implement a turn timer so that if a player takes too long without making a move, a random move is made for them
9. Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
10. Be creative! Bend the rules and give it a twist!

====================================================================================

Demo your game to the class and then answer some or all of these questions:

1. What features did you include?
2. Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
3. What was the most difficult part of the project?
4. What was your favourite part to work on?
5. What would you like to add next?
6. Be ready to field some additional questions.
